This means you need to think in a structured, analytical objective and honest way.  The best way to do this is to answer the following questions and record your answers on the appropriate section of the App.  It is important to answer each question in depth and not simply answer with one or two words or a short sentence – that is not true reflection. 
Why did this learning opportunity come about/why were the actions taken/why were other actions not taken/why was the actions successful or unsuccessful? 
So What does all of this mean/so what is significant about this/so what are the implications/so what are you actually saying about all of this?
What next? What can be learned from this? What else could have been done? What could be done in the future – the same actions or different actions and why?

<p class="write-up"><span>You can use text or a voice recording to document your reflection which you then upload to the App.</span></p>
